						<h2>DelaneyMethod CMS License Agreement</h2>
						<p>Version 1.0.0, last updated on Sept 16, 2017</p>
						<p>This license agreement (the &quot;License Agreement&quot;) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single legal entity) and DelaneyMethod. (&quot;DelaneyMethod&quot;) covering the installation, use, copying, and distribution of the version of DelaneyMethod CMS code contained in the distributable package delivered at the time of download from DelaneyMethod and any accompanying distributable files, data, and materials (&quot;DelaneyMethod CMS&quot;).</p>
						<p>Please read the license terms below. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this License, then do not download, install, use, copy, or distribute DelaneyMethod CMS.</p>
						<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
						<h4>1. Your Acceptance of this License Agreement</h4>
						<p>You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using, installing, copying, or distributing DelaneyMethod CMS. Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by DelaneyMethod, your use, installation, copying, or distribution of DelaneyMethod CMS indicates your acceptance of this License Agreement.</p>
						<p>The terms and conditions of this License Agreement describe the permitted use of each single installation (hereinafter, a &quot;Licensed Copy&quot;) of DelaneyMethod CMS.</p>
						<h4>2. Scope of License</h4>
						<p>Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, DelaneyMethod grants to you, for each Licensed Copy, a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, license to use, install, copy, or distribute DelaneyMethod CMS.</p>
						<p>All rights of any kind in DelaneyMethod CMS which are not expressly granted in this License Agreement are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by DelaneyMethod. DelaneyMethod is protected by applicable national and international laws and treaties.</p>
						<p>You may use, install, copy, and distribute DelaneyMethod CMS solely as expressly provided in this License. You may not rent, lease, loan, sublicense, modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on DelaneyMethod CMS, in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so.</p>
						<p>You shall not use, integrate, combine, or otherwise exercise any license rights under this License Agreement in any manner that would render the source code contained in DelaneyMethod CMS Open Source Software. As used herein, &quot;Open Source Software&quot; means any software that (in whole or in part) includes, or is otherwise derived in any manner from, any software that is distributed under conditions that include: (i) licensees of such software are authorised to access, modify, and make derivative works of the source code for the software; (ii) licensees of source code of such software are not obligated to maintain the confidentiality of such source code; and (iii) licensees of such software are required, even under limited circumstances, to grant licenses to the source code or derivative works thereof, that licenses include rights to the licensee’s intellectual property.</p>
						<h4>3. License Agreement Model</h4>
						<p>This is a single-installation license, meaning you may integrate a Licensed Copy into one public-facing (&quot;Internet&quot;) or internal (&quot;intranet&quot;) web root directory at a time (the &quot;Website&quot;). You may also install and use DelaneyMethod CMS without limitation for local development and testing purposes.</p>
						<h4>4. License Agreement Validity</h4>
						<p>This license is valid only if the Website is a work that uses DelaneyMethod CMS, and does not compete with DelaneyMethod CMS.</p>
						<h4>5. Installation and Usage</h4>
						<p>You may install and use DelaneyMethod CMS only in the nature that is described in DelaneyMethod CMS’s <a href="https://www.delaneymethod.com/cms/docs" style="color:#ad1457;" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
						<p>You may not make any alterations to DelaneyMethod CMS’s code or the database tables/columns put in place by DelaneyMethod CMS, unless instructed to do so by DelaneyMethod. If you have a need that is not addressed via DelaneyMethod CMS’s core feature set, and you lack the means to write a plugin to fill the need yourself, please contact <a href="mailto:hello@delaneymethod.com" style="color:#ad1457;">hello@delaneymethod.com</a>.</p>
						<h4>6. Updates</h4>
						<p>DelaneyMethod will provide you with free updates to the edition of DelaneyMethod CMS applicable to your Licensed Copy for the remainder of DelaneyMethod CMS’s lifespan. Such updates will include any updates for DelaneyMethod CMS that are released by DelaneyMethod for general distribution to DelaneyMethod CMS licensees. DelaneyMethod has no obligation to provide you with any updates that are not released for general distribution to DelaneyMethod’s other licensees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate DelaneyMethod to provide updates to you under any circumstances.</p>
						<p>DelaneyMethod may develop and release future incremental versions of DelaneyMethod CMS, including additional features yet to be developed. Such future versions of DelaneyMethod CMS may, at DelaneyMethod’s sole discretion, be released pursuant to different terms and conditions different from this License Agreement, and may be subject to additional license fees.</p>
						<h4>7. License Transfers</h4>
						<p>You may transfer your right to use the Licensed Copy to a third party, provided (a) that you transfer this License Agreement and the transferee accepts this License Agreement, (b) that you retain no copies of the Licensed Copy and its associated license key, and (c) that you notify DelaneyMethod about the transfer in writing or by email, providing the details of the new licensee. Such transfer involves the termination of the initial license granted to you under this License Agreement. After the transfer you will no longer have any right to use the Licensed Copy.</p>
						<h4>8. Reservation of Rights and Ownership</h4>
						<p>DelaneyMethod reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this License Agreement. DelaneyMethod is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. DelaneyMethod owns the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in DelaneyMethod CMS, its files, and its source code. For the avoidance of doubt, DelaneyMethod CMS is licensed, not sold. This License Agreement does not grant you any rights to trademarks or service marks.</p>
						<h4>9. Consent to Use of Data</h4>
						<p>You agree that DelaneyMethod may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to information about your installation of DelaneyMethod CMS and your server environment, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to DelaneyMethod CMS. DelaneyMethod may use this information to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>
						<h4>10. Termination</h4>
						<p>Without prejudice to any other rights, DelaneyMethod may terminate this License Agreement if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the License. In such event, your right to use, install, copy, and distribute DelaneyMethod CMS terminates automatically and you must then destroy all copies of DelaneyMethod CMS in your possession.</p>
						<h4>11. Warranty</h4>
						<p>DelaneyMethod represents and warrants that it has full title and ownership to DelaneyMethod CMS and has the authority to grant the license hereunder. To the best of DelaneyMethod’s knowledge, DelaneyMethod CMS does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party and DelaneyMethod has not received any notice regarding any alleged infringement thereof.</p>

						<h4>14.  Limitation of Liability</h4>
						<p>In no event shall DelaneyMethod’s liability exceed the license fees paid.</p>
						<h4>15. Waiver</h4>
						<p>The waiver of, or failure to enforce, by either party any breach or default hereunder by the other shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent or continuing breach or default.</p>
